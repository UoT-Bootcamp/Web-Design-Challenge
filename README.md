# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

For this project, we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past project. we'll be plotting weather data.

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them. We will also use media query to make our page responseive.

This website is consist of 7 pages total, including:

## "Landing" page

This page contains:

* An explanation of the project.
* Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

### Landing Page - Large Screen

The website, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). 


I have also deployed the website to the GitHub pages. Feel free to click the below link to visit the page:
